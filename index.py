Create a class called BankAccount that encapsulates information about a bank account, 
such as the account holder's name, account number, and balance. 
The class should have methods for depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the account balance. 
Ensure that the balance cannot be accessed or modified outside the class. 
Use encapsulation to ensure that the data of the BankAccount object is secure.

Create a class called Rectangle that represents a rectangle object. 
The class should have attributes for the length and width of the rectangle 
and methods for calculating the area and perimeter of the rectangle. 
Then create a subclass called Square that inherits from Rectangle 
and has a method for calculating the diagonal length of the square. 
Ensure that the length and width of the square are always equal by overriding the parent class's
